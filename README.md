# Tutorials

These tutorials provide step-by-step instructions to build and deploy [Sunny Day Flooding Sensors](https://tarheels.live/sunnydayflood/) to measure coastal flooding. Open an [issue](https://github.com/SunnyD-Flood-Sensor-Network/tutorials/issues) to ask question or provide documentation suggestions!

## Overview
The sensor framework – which we coin SuDS: the Sunny Day flood Sensors ☀️ – consists of a pressure logger deployed within a storm drain and a communications gateway equipped with a camera. 

Data are streamed to a web-based (open-source) [platform](https://github.com/SunnyD-Flood-Sensor-Network/SunnyD-Flooding) for real-time communication of flood hazard. 

This framework overcomes limitations of existing instrumentation by: 
1. identifying street flooding from a combination of under- and above-ground sources, and
2. allowing for real-time communication of flood depths and visual confirmation of flood extent.

## Hardware - Link these items to Wiki pages
There SunnyD hardware is comprised of two assemblies, the [SunnyDay sensor](hardware/SunnyD_sensor.md) and the [SunnyDay gateway](SunnyD_gateway.md). The linked documents describe the production and configuration of these assemblies.

## Installation - Link these items to Wiki pages
