# Tutorials

The tutorials [**in this repo's wiki**](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials/wiki) provide step-by-step instructions to build and deploy [Sunny Day Flooding Sensors](https://tarheels.live/sunnydayflood/) to measure coastal flooding. Open an [issue](https://github.com/SunnyD-Flood-Sensor-Network/tutorials/issues) to ask question or provide documentation suggestions!

## Overview
The sensor framework ‚Äì which we coin SuDS: the <ins>**Su**</ins>nny <ins>**D**</ins>ay flood <ins>**S**</ins>ensors ‚òÄÔ∏èüåä ‚Äì consists of a pressure logger deployed within a storm drain and a communications gateway equipped with a camera.

Data are streamed to a web-based (open-source) platform for real-time communication of flood hazard. See the project's [data viewer](https://sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu) and its [code](https://github.com/SunnyD-Flood-Sensor-Network/SunnyD-Flooding)

This framework overcomes limitations of existing instrumentation by: 
1. Identifying street flooding from a combination of under- and above-ground sources, and
2. Allowing for real-time communication of flood depths and visual confirmation of flood extent.
